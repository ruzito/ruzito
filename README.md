## Hi there, here I included some info about myself

### Knowledge

- I have a bachelor degree from Faculty of Information Technology, CTU in Prague
- I'm currently using vscode, but I have played with vim before and I'm looking forward to try out emacs with evil mode.
- I'm most familiar with `c++`, `python`, `bash` and `javascript` but I have also worked with `c`, `asm`, `java`, `scala`, `latex`, `lisp`, `prolog`, `mathematica`, `ruby` and `typescript` as part of some school projects and homeworks and in my free time I am looking into `rust`.
- I also use linux as my daily driver and I'm not afraid of bash scripting and dotfiles editing
- As part of my work at school I created a `mysql` database, API with `node.js` and `express.js` (now I know I should have used `typescript` there as well ðŸ˜„), configured simple `nginx` web server and `webpack` to compile `react`, `typescript` and `sass`.
- I am more than willing to learn more technologies.
- I like learning about interesting data structures.

### Preference

- I prefer statically typed languages. I think that the signature of a function should be representative of it's capability. Types should therefore statically ban as much invalid arguments as possible. And the return type of function should be expressive as well, if function just returns tuple of values, you than have to go to the documentation or worse into the code to see at what position does the function return XYZ in that tuple. At least return something with NAMED data fields.
- Currently my favourite language is `c++` (but it may be a Stockholm syndrome from our school homeworks ðŸ˜‰), tho I acknowledge it has some serious issues compared to for example rust. I like python, tho I think it is not suited for bigger projects due to dynamic typing.
- I think rust has a lot of features i dreamt of in c++, but I think it has a big stigma around `unsafe` keyword. I think it should be ok to use `unsafe` when implementing some data structure or container, like graphs and so on. This data structure would be easily tested. The safety of a language should be there to safeguard the usage of those libraries, or in other words, the bussiness logic. I really love rust's the traits and impls, AST based macros, option and result, sane defaults for features like const, mut and so on, pass by move/reference, package manager and one trivial constructor others are just static factories.
- From c++ I like that it has RAII. No garbadge collection that would slow down the program. Just be careful what you return out of the scope.
- From scala I like it's match/case feature, idea of uniform calling syntax (altho if I remember correctly there were some cases where it wasn't so uniform) and that there are no statements, only expressions. Especially useful with ifs and matchcases. Or for more complex initialization of constants.
- From java I like the machine readability of the code. Mainly all the support java has for IDE integration, all the refactoring actions and so on.
- I'm still not sure about java annotations. If one is not familiar with a particular annotation, it can totally destroy the understandability of the code. Sure once one knows all the annotations by heart it is somewhat nice, but training newcomers to a java codebase can be stressful due to the annotations. They can totally change the meaning of the code. It totally destroys any possible assumptions about from where and when is this stuff called and with what parameters, and so on and so on and so on. It is a powerfull tool. But c++ template metaprogramming is also a powerfull tool, but it's completely unreadable if you don't know the templates by heart.
- I like python decorators a little. The thing about them is that they only change the function itself. Nothing changes somewhere else.
- The thing I dislike about java is that I feel like I'm trying to start a steam engine when creating a project in Java. Not sure exactly why, but every time (seriously, every, single, time) I had to do something in java, I always had to deal with something not working in a different way from anyone else.
- I like when language creators clearly show how to use CLI instead of relying on a proprietary IDE. It's the job of that IDE to show how to use a language with it, but using a language should be possible without an IDE. If you had a shell and a text editor it should be somewhat easy enough to use (at least whith some helper scripts).

### Personality

- I am quite bad at games of every type. But I enjoy board and card games (I wouldn't bet any money on me tho).
- I am not a very social creature, but I think I'm quite friendly and cheerful once I'm familiar with people around me.
- I do not enjoy pubs. Mainly because there will be a bunch of new people around and because I am not a big fan of beer.
