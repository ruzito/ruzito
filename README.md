## Hi there

### Knowledge

- Iâ€™m currently learning computer science at Czech university ÄŒVUT FIT
- I'm currently using vscode, but I have played with vim before and I'm looking forward to try out emacs with evil mode.
- I'm most familiar with c++ and javascript but I have also worked with c, java, scala, latex, python, typescript as part of some school projects and homeworks
- I also use linux as my daily driver and I'm not afraid of some bash scripting and dotfile editing
- As part of my work at school I created a mysql database, API with node.js (now I know I should have used typescript there as well ðŸ˜„), configured simple nginx web server and webpack to compile react, typescript and sass.
- I am more than willing to learn more technologies and right now my main focus would be to learn a proper team workflow.

### Preference

- Currently my favourite language is c++ (but it may be a Stockholm syndrome from progtest ðŸ˜‰)
- The think i dislike the most about it is package management, and second is a lack of (at least compile time) reflection and annotations.
- I think I might learn Rust in future.
- I dislike Java. I feel like I'm trying to start a steam engine when creating a project in Java. Not sure exactly why.

### Personality

- I am quite bad at games of every type. Tho I enjoy board and card games (but I wouldn't bet any money on me).
- I am not a very social creature, but I think I can cooperate well once I'm familiar with people around me.
- I do not enjoy pubs. I enjoy tearooms, tho I am never the one who calls the group together.
