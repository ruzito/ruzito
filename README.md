## Hi there, here I included some info about myself

### Knowledge

- I have a bachelor degree from Faculty of Information Technology, CTU in Prague
- I'm currently using vscode, but I have played with vim before and I'm looking forward to try out emacs with evil mode.
- I'm most familiar with `c++`, `python` and `javascript` but I have also worked with `c`, `java`, `scala`, `latex`, `lisp`, `prolog`, `typescript` as part of some school projects and homeworks.
- I also use linux as my daily driver and I'm not afraid of bash scripting and dotfiles editing
- As part of my work at school I created a `mysql` database, API with `node.js` and `express.js` (now I know I should have used `typescript` there as well ðŸ˜„), configured simple `nginx` web server and `webpack` to compile `react`, `typescript` and `sass`.
- I am more than willing to learn more technologies and right now my main focus would be to learn a proper team workflow.
- I am familiar with `git`, but I haven't used it in any larger team. So I probably have to learn the workflow.
- I am familiar with various algorithms, data structures and design patterns.

### Preference

- I strongly recommend strongly typed languages. I think that dynamic typing is really bad for stability, security and maintainability of code. On one hand you'd like to keep code simple, thus implementing guidelines like "use functions as intended and expect your functions to be used as intended" but for a secure code that tells you about bugs as soon as possible you need to "expect bugs in every external and internal inputs". If you have strongly typed language you just implement more strict types to define exactly what the input should be. So that e.g. `double divide(double a, double b)` will become `safe_finite_double divide(safe_finite_double a, safe_finite_nonzero_double b)` where `safe_finite_double` means `double` without all NaN values and without +-inf and `safe_finite_nonzero_double` is `safe_finite_double` without +-0 values. Hopefully the language has a way of doing that, if not at least do an (prefferably constexpr/static) assertion.
- Currently my favourite language is `c++` (but it may be a Stockholm syndrome from our school homeworks ðŸ˜‰) I like python, tho I think it is not suited for bigger projects due to dynamic typing.
- The think i dislike the most about `c++` is package management right now (2022) tho it is hopefully coming soon with modules, and second is a lack of (at least compile time) reflection and annotations, some (maybe templated) way of doing python decorators would be interesting.
- But I enjoy the well defined object lifetime rules and lack of garbage collector. Tho I would like to have clear rules for copy elision on return.
- I think I might learn `Rust` in future.
- **I dislike `java`. I feel like I'm trying to start a steam engine when creating a project in Java. Not sure exactly why.**
- I like when language creators clearly show how to use CLI instead of relying on a proprietary IDE.

### Personality

- I am quite bad at games of every type. But I enjoy board and card games (I wouldn't bet any money on me tho).
- I am not a very social creature, but I think I can cooperate well once I'm familiar with people around me. (High-functioning introvert I guess)
- I do not enjoy pubs. I do enjoy tearooms, but I am never the one who calls the group together.
